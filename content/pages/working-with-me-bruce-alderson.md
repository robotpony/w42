**"The thinking that goes into your software *is* the software"**. It's a philosophy that has guided me through over 30 years of making things with code. I wrote my first program when I was 8, a BASIC adventure game that I proudly saved to tape. What I didn't expect was that my flakey tape drive would become my first teacher in the importance of documentation. After losing several programs to that unreliable piece of hardware, I learned to write out design first, a habit that became fundamental to how I work today.

From tape drives to AI, I'm still excited about making things with computers.

## The winding path

My journey through technology hasn't been linear, either. After I learned basic, I struggled through C when I was 12, then I  found clarity using Pascal, and finally discovered my long love affair with C++, and the many languages related to it. But the real foundation came from work that had nothing to do with computers.

I started delivering newspapers when I was 8 and worked full-time in restaurants when I was 15, through to the end of college. I spent soul-crushing time as a millworker, counting down the seconds every day, and managed a 7-11 (which taught me exactly what I *didn't* want to do with my life). These experiences weren't detours - they were education in work ethic, dealing with people, and understanding what ~meaningful~ difficult work feels like.

My technical evolution mirrors the industry's growth. I started with real-time data collection systems, writing device drivers and protocol stacks, porting code across multiple CPUs and operating systems. From there I moved into systems architecture, then cloud platforms as they emerged, followed by SaaS applications where the focus shifted to solving real business problems at scale.

Eventually I found my way to front-end development and design - the place where all that backend complexity meets human beings. I've managed teams and led engineering organizations, but always with the same goal: building things that matter to the people who use them.

The constraints of each era taught me something valuable. Real-time systems demanded discipline. Cloud platforms taught scalability thinking. SaaS forced me to understand business value. Front-end work reminded me that in the end, it's all about the human experience.

## How I work

My approach is shaped by early lessons and hard-won experience:

**Document first.** That tape drive failure at age 8 burned this into my brain. I start with sketches and storyboards before jumping to code. I believe deeply in the power of good diagrams to clarify thinking, both for myself and my teams.

**Bias toward action.** Perfect is the enemy of shipped, and shipped is how you learn what actually works. Sometimes you just have to fucking do it.

**Process is bullshit; method and practice are crucial.** I've seen too many teams get lost in ceremony while losing sight of what they're building and why. I don't oppose process, but I err on the side of methods and practices that ship great software quickly and efficiently.

**Focus on fundamentals, embrace new tools when they serve the work.** The principles don't change much, but the tools keep getting better. I'm currently fascinated by AI/ML applications, especially using natural language to define how humans interact with systems.

## Current obsessions

These days I'm mostly focused on architecture, product management, and engineering leadership, but I still get my hands dirty with code on a daily basis. I also love game jams and rapid prototyping. There's something magical about turning an idea into a playable experience under tight constraints. I'm deep into generative art experiments using Pico-8, a fantasy console that brings back all the joy of programming on ridiculously constrained hardware.

My current technical fascination is using natural language to define human-computer interactions. We're finally reaching the point where computers can write code by iterating through possibilities - something I predicted years ago, though I also thought Atari would take over the world, so my track record is mixed.

## Fun facts

**Language evolution:** My journey went BASIC → C → Pascal → 6800/00 ASM→ C++ → JS/Node.js, among dozens of others. Node and JavaScript are probably my favorite tools for prototyping web things, though I love most languages and frameworks now.

**Best tech prediction:** Computers will write code by iterating through possibilities. Hello, AI agents!

**Worst tech prediction:** Atari will dominate computing. The kid version of me was *very* optimistic about the company with the great Fuji logo. Unrelated: the Atari 400 was my first computer, which I soon upgraded to a used 800 with my paper route windfall. Good times!

**Beyond code:** I'm serious about cooking (those restaurant years left their mark), dabble with keyboards and drums, and create through sketching, block printing, and photography. The creative process informs the technical work more than you might expect.

**Character building:** My worst jobs taught the best lessons. Millwork taught me to value meaningful work. Managing a 7-11 taught me... well, never to manage a 7-11 again.

**Technology I was wrong about, and that's okay:** Python's whitespace syntax used to grind my gears, especially against my early love of C-based languages. Objective-C looked visually unappealing to me early on (and boy do I like Swift better). Java seemed like a breeding ground for FactoryFactoryBuilderFactories. These tools produce such lovely software, however, that I am happily wrong about all three. It's why the saying, *strong convictions, loosely held* is so important, especially as we learn.

## A few select writings

Here are a few essays that capture different aspects of how I think about the craft:

- **[Real work is boring (but I love it)](/blog/2011/real-work-is-boring-but-i-love-it/)** - On finding method in the work and the unexpected paths to mastery,
- **[The art of code review](/blog/2013/the-art-of-code-review/)** - My philosophy on nurturing teams and using review as a teaching tool,
- **[Thinking in diagrams](/blog/2015/thinking-in-diagrams-a-developers-guide-to-learning-to-love-drawing-design/)** - Why visual thinking matters in software design,
- **[Being honest about technical debt](/blog/2016/being-honest-about-technical-debt/)** - Distinguishing intentional debt from regrettable decisions.

I write to help find my perspective, to reflect, and to give me a chance to see my ideas from different angles. Sometimes I vent. Sometimes I'm processing. Sometimes I just want to be helpful.
