## Tired

**ChatGPT wrappers with no moat.** You know the ones—they're basically a textarea that calls OpenAI's API. There are literally thousands of these. They'll be gone within 18 months.

**"AI-powered" as a meaningful differentiator.** Saying your app is "AI-powered" in 2026 will sound as ridiculous as "database-powered" does today. Of course it uses AI. Everything will.

**The fantasy that LLMs alone can handle complex business logic.** I've watched too many teams learn this the hard way. Pure LLMs are chaos machines; brilliant chaos machines, but chaos nonetheless.

**Demo-ware that can't handle production.** That amazing demo that works 95% of the time? That 5% failure rate means it's unusable for anything that matters.

## Wired

**Boring, reliable AI infrastructure.** Someone's going to be the Stripe of AI; making integration so simple that it's just another API call. Probably multiple someones, actually.

**Vertical-specific solutions with real domain expertise.** The winners won't be "ChatGPT for X." They'll be companies that deeply understand X and happen to use AI to solve real problems in that space.

**Hybrid systems that combine deterministic code with probabilistic understanding.** Use AI for what it's good at (understanding messy human input), use traditional code for what it's good at (reliable execution). Revolutionary, I know.

**Tools that make AI integration a commodity.** Just like AWS made servers boring (in the best way), someone's going to make AI inference boring. Can't wait.
