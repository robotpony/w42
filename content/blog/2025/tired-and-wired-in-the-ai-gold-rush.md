We've been watching the AI gold rush unfold for the past two years now, and honestly? It's giving me serious déjà vu. Remember the early days of mobile apps when everyone and their cousin was building a flashlight app? Or when "on the blockchain" was supposedly going to revolutionize everything from grocery shopping to dental records?

We're in that phase with AI right now. The phase where adding "AI-powered" to your deck is supposed to make VCs throw money at you. Where every developer with a weekend and an OpenAI API key thinks they're building the next unicorn. Where demos that work most of the time are being pitched as production-ready solutions.

I'm not an AI skeptic. Far from it. I've been neck-deep in building AI integrations for the past year, and the technology genuinely excites me in ways that few things have since I first discovered I could make computers do things with BASIC back in the ‘70s. But there's a world of difference between what's actually valuable and what's just noise.

So in the spirit of those old Wired magazine "Wired, Tired" lists (remember those?), here's my take on what's already exhausting versus what's actually worth paying attention to in the AI space. Fair warning: if you're building a ChatGPT wrapper, you might not like what comes next.

## Wired

**Boring, reliable AI infrastructure.** Someone's going to be the Stripe of AI; making integration so simple that it's just another API call. Probably multiple someones, actually.

**Vertical-specific solutions with real domain expertise.** The winners won't be "ChatGPT for X." They'll be companies that deeply understand X and happen to use AI to solve real problems in that space.

**Hybrid systems that combine deterministic code with probabilistic understanding.** Use AI for what it's good at (understanding messy human input), use traditional code for what it's good at (reliable execution). Revolutionary, I know.

**Tools that make AI integration a commodity.** Just like AWS made servers boring (in the best way), someone's going to make AI inference boring. Can't wait.

**Local-first AI that respects privacy.** The pendulum is swinging back. Companies are realizing that shipping their customer data to OpenAI isn't always the answer. Local models that run on-device or on-prem, even if they're slightly dumber, are going to own entire market segments.

## Tired

**ChatGPT wrappers with no moat.** You know the ones; they're a `textarea` that calls OpenAI's API. There are literally thousands of these. They'll be gone within 18 months.

**"AI-powered" as a meaningful differentiator.** Saying your app is "AI-powered" in a few years will sound as ridiculous as "database-powered" does today. Of course it uses AI. Everything will.

**The fantasy that LLMs alone can handle complex business logic.** I've watched too many teams learn this the hard way. Pure LLMs are chaos machines; brilliant chaos machines, but chaos nonetheless.

**Demo-ware that can't handle production.** That amazing demo that works 95% of the time? That 5% failure rate means it's unusable for anything that matters.

**The "AI will replace developers" panic.** Every few months, someone breathlessly announces that programming is dead. Meanwhile, I'm spending more time than ever debugging why the AI-generated code thinks undefined is a valid currency format. Turns out, computers still need adults in the room.

The real opportunity isn't in slapping AI onto existing products. 
It's in understanding what this technology actually enables and, more 
importantly, what it doesn't. It’s in the boring stuff: the infrastructure, the reliability, and the domain expertise. That's where the real work is.

Just like the web didn't need more flashlight apps, AI doesn't need 
more ChatGPT wrappers. What it needs is people willing to do the 
hard, unsexy work of making it actually useful.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go build something boring.
