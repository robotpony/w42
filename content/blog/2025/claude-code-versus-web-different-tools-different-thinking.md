# Claude Code versus Claude Web: Different Tools, Different Thinking

I was three paragraphs into a blog post when I realized I was fighting my tools again. The ideas were flowing, but Claude Web kept losing context of my style guide. Each response drifted further from my voice, turning my punchy prose into corporate mush. That's when it hit me: I was using the wrong Claude for the job.

Here's the thing: we now have two distinct ways to work with Claude, and they're surprisingly different beasts. Same underlying AI, completely different workflows. It took me embarrassingly long to figure out when to use which one.

## The Tale of Two Claudes

When Anthropic released Claude Code, I assumed it was just the web interface with file access. Classic developer thinking—judge the tool by its features, not its purpose. Turns out that's like comparing a sketchbook to a drafting table. Both let you draw, but they shape your thinking in fundamentally different ways.

Claude Web feels like a conversation with a knowledgeable colleague. Quick, iterative, perfect for exploration. You can reference Google Docs, point to GitHub repos, and iterate on ideas without much setup. It's the digital equivalent of whiteboarding—messy, fast, and surprisingly effective for certain kinds of work.

Claude Code, on the other hand, is more like pair programming with someone who actually read the documentation. It's slower, more deliberate, and dramatically better at maintaining context across a project. But that power comes with overhead that isn't always worth it.

## Where Each Tool Shines

After months of bouncing between them, patterns emerged.

**Claude Web excels at:**
- First drafts and creative exploration
- Career conversations and strategic thinking  
- Quick research with access to cloud resources
- Brainstorming when you need rapid iteration
- Anything where perfect adherence to style doesn't matter

I've written entire essay outlines in Claude Web, had it review my resume, and used it to think through complex career decisions. The conversational flow keeps ideas moving when that's what matters most.

**Claude Code dominates when:**
- Working with local files and codebases
- Maintaining consistent style across documents
- Deep analysis that benefits from seeing the whole picture
- Refining and polishing existing work
- Any task where file organization matters

The difference became clear when I started moving blog posts to Claude Code after the first draft. With my style guide loaded locally, it maintains my voice consistently. No more corporate drift. No more losing the plot three paragraphs in.

## The Friction Points

Of course, nothing's perfect. Switching between tools reveals some sharp edges.

The biggest surprise? Claude Code takes 2-4x longer for the same requests. Ask for a blog post edit in Web, get it in 30 seconds. Ask in Code, watch it think for two minutes. Initially, this drove me crazy. Was it broken? Was I doing something wrong?

Turns out it's doing more work—checking more context, considering more possibilities, being more thorough. Once I understood this, I started using the slowness as a feature, not a bug. When I want quick and dirty, Web. When I want considered and careful, Code.

The Google Docs gap hurts though. Claude Code can't easily access my cloud documents, forcing me to maintain local copies of style guides and reference materials. Setting up an MCP might help, but that's another tool, another configuration, another thing to maintain. Sometimes the simplicity of copy-paste wins.

And here's the real friction: transitioning between tools is entirely manual. Start in Web, realize you need Code, copy everything over, set up your context, start again. It's like switching from pencil sketches to CAD software—necessary sometimes, but hardly seamless. An automatic handoff would be magical. Export conversation to Code workspace? Yes please.

## The Scaling Moment

This tool split reminds me of an old pattern in software development. Remember when we all used simple text editors until our projects hit that complexity wall? That moment when syntax highlighting wasn't enough, when you needed real refactoring tools, when grep stopped cutting it?

Same thing here. There's a clear inflection point where Claude Web stops being the right tool. For me, it's when:
- The document exceeds 1000 words
- Style consistency becomes critical
- I need to reference multiple local files
- The project spans multiple sessions

Below that threshold, Claude Code is overkill. Above it, Claude Web is underwhelming. Learning to recognize that moment—that's the real skill.

## Practical Lessons

After months of trial and error, here's what works:

**Start in Web for exploration.** Let ideas flow without setup overhead. Don't worry about style guides or file organization yet. Just think and iterate.

**Move to Code when structure matters.** First draft done? Style guide critical? Multiple files to juggle? Time to switch tools. Yes, the transition is manual and annoying. Do it anyway.

**Embrace appropriate slowness.** Claude Code's deliberate pace isn't a bug. Use Web when you need fast iterations, Code when you need depth. Don't fight the tool's nature.

**Maintain local style guides.** If you're serious about consistent voice, keep your guidelines in Markdown locally. The Google Docs gap is real, and copy-paste beats broken workflows.

**Know when not to switch.** One-off tasks, quick questions, exploratory conversations—these belong in Web. Don't overthink it.

## The Future of Our AI Workflows

We're in the awkward adolescence of AI-assisted creation. Two tools, similar capabilities, different strengths, manual handoffs. It's messy but workable. In five years, we'll look back at this separation the way we look at compiling code by hand—quaint but necessary for its time.

Until then, we work with what we have. Use Claude Web for thinking, Claude Code for building. Start fast, finish thoughtfully. And maybe, just maybe, someone will build that automatic transition we all want.

The tools shape the work. Choose accordingly.

## Missing Elements to Consider:

**Code examples showing the difference in approach:**
- Side-by-side comparison of responses to the same prompt
- Example of style drift in Claude Web vs consistency in Claude Code
- Configuration snippets for setting up Claude Code effectively

**Specific metrics on that 2-4x slowdown:**
- Actual timed examples
- What Claude Code is doing during those longer processing times
- When the extra time is worth it vs when it's waste

**Screenshot comparisons:**
- Claude Web interface with a blog post draft
- Claude Code with the same content and style guide loaded
- The manual transition process
- File organization in Claude Code

**Future predictions about tool convergence:**
- Will these tools merge?
- What would ideal AI-assisted writing look like?
- How might context sharing evolve?
- The possibility of tool-specific models vs universal interfaces
