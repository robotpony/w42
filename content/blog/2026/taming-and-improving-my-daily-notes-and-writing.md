Outline:
- I'm working on a set of Obsidian plugins to tweak how I write notes, essays, blog posts, etc.
- Space Command is a tool for TODOs and IDEAs, that helps with focus using #focus and priority tags
	- focus allows for ideas and future tasks to be recorded, but
	- the current focus is clear so we can return to it quickly
	- the tool also has some basic AI features like review text, define word, etc.
- Hugo command is a tool for managing a Hugo blog within Obsidian
	- it makes it easy to see/edit/add new content
	- planning to connect to publish tools
		- build site
		- view locally
		- sync site
		- may need to rely on key scripts or installs?
		- checks before publish?
	- and also some basic AI tooling for content reviews, draft questions, etc.
