I've found a productive habit of working on plugins for my daily work:

- Obsidian plugins for managing TODOs, unfurling links, and managing Hugo sites
- Chrome plugins for debugging very specific problems
- Google document plugins for specific types of writing problems
- Google spreadsheet plugins to connect local data stores
- Command line tools for slicing, dicing, and automating things

Not to mention:
- Fun little games
- Side projects

The workflow is key:

- define a narrow slice proof of concept
- iterate
	- test
	- tweak
	- add features
	- repeat

The key is to test carefully, and review code carefully. 

Is it faster? Yes and no. It's incrementally faster, but you can work on a project in the background. In fact, I have some tasks running now. If you have ADHD, this is a dream, as you can fill your idle cycles and prevent full distraction. (TODO: needs a link)

Customizing Claude code helps make iteration more consistent. My workflow (link) has a command for each step, and each type of step:

- research
- feature
- bug
- nit
- finish
- cleanup
