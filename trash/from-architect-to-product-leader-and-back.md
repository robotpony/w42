I've been thinking about product management as I consider my next project. Looking back on my journey from tech lead to full-time PdM at Mailchimp and Intuit, I'm increasingly convinced that hybrid roles might be where the real magic happens. But let me start from the beginning.

## The push toward product

Two things have consistently pushed me toward product leadership over the years. First, I've always thought about software holistically. Focusing on only one part of the problem tends to warp your thinking about the overall solution space. You get caught in the weeds and lose sight of what actually matters. Second, I've watched too many projects get crushed by cutting the wrong scope or over-indexing on product ceremonies instead of solving real problems.

The breaking point came during a project where we cut core features that most of the engineering team knew were critical. The decision was made to hit project deadlines, but it was the ultimate failure of the project. We pushed back a reasonable amount, but scope was owned by product, and the decision was final. The project limped along with limited success before eventually getting cancelled, the timeline drawn out by scope waffling and architectural debt.

Here's the thing: pressure on scope often signals deeper issues with the business case or general approach. When you're frantically cutting features that everyone knows are essential, you're not managing scope, you're managing failure.

## Life as a full-time PM

Making the jump to full-time product management at Mailchimp was revelatory. Suddenly I could think about product features on their own terms, linking them directly to user value rather than just engineering metrics. I could measure things that affected real people using our product. Despite the tradeoffs of stepping away from engineering and design, the perspective was worth it.

My technical background turned out to be a superpower. Having experience in architecture and managing engineers meant I could work one-on-one with developers to further their careers while driving deep changes in the product. I understood the engineering implications of product decisions in ways that let me make better tradeoffs.

But there was a significant cost: taking a backseat to architectural decisions. Most of the time this worked fine, but occasionally there are fissures in a problem that can only be found by exploring both architecture and user needs simultaneously. Innovation happens at those intersections. This might be why startups are often more successful at innovation. When everyone wears multiple hats, those connections are natural rather than negotiated.

As a PM, I found myself having to make cases for "features and tech together" rather than directly shaping technical direction. We worked closely with engineering and made architectural changes over time, but that disconnect always slowed us down.

## The role's inconsistency problem

One thing that surprised me about being a dedicated PM: the role is wildly different across organizations. This isn't always good. The industry loves to talk about PMs as "CEOs of the product," but I've never seen a company where that's actually true. CEO means so many different things anyway.

It's better to think of product management as wrangling interesting features, plus scope and business need management. The mythical "CEO of product" sets expectations that don't match reality and creates frustration on all sides.

## Metrics and what actually matters

Looking back, here's what I'd tell my past self who was just starting to think about product work: **think about metrics sooner**. They help clarify your actual goals and objectives. But more importantly, look for things that make a real difference to humans using your tools. Think about what that means. Don't get sucked into vanity metrics or manipulative ways of motivating users.

Focus on saving people time, getting out of their way, and providing value they couldn't find elsewhere. The best products feel invisible. They solve problems so elegantly that users forget the software exists.

## The case for hybrid

My ideal role combines product work with prototyping, customer research, and data analysis. The goal is always to serve customers better, and using all of my skills feels like the most direct path to real value.

Here's what I think the industry needs: larger companies should spin off real startups with teams that are good at wearing all the hats. Additionally, we need more senior IC positions that combine facets of both engineering and product thinking. This would enable a whole set of interesting thinkers who currently get forced into narrow specialization.

The innovation happens at those fissures where technical architecture meets user needs. When you can see both sides simultaneously, when you can prototype the technical solution while researching the user problem, you find opportunities that pure specialists miss.

Maybe the future isn't about choosing between being technical or being product-focused. Maybe it's about being both, and creating space for people who think holistically about the entire problem. The tools are there. The need is there. We just need to stop pretending that artificial role boundaries serve anyone, especially not the users whose problems we're trying to solve.
